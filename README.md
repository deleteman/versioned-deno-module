# Versioned-deno-module
This is a sample repository to show how to use the tag name as the version of the package. 
The tag name is included in the RAW url of a file, thus allowing us to link to our modules directly from our scripts and still include the version without having to worry about configuring our own CDNs for distribution.

For an example just include _https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deleteman/versioned-deno-module/4.0/hello.ts_ in your code and change 4.0 for 2.0 and see what happens.
